## Summary

For pulpcore and its related tools, there is no written process to describe giving the commit bit to
a contributor for all or a portion of the codebase. The existing committers want to openly document
the process.


## Motivation

Historically the commit bit was given on day 0 when hired on the core team at Red Hat.  In Oct 2017
the existing committers decided to stop that practice and instead document an open process.
Engineers hired on the Pulp team since Oct '17 have not received commit bit.

We have not yet documented an open process of which to give a proven contributor commit access to
all or a portion of the codebase.


## Scope

This formally applies to the following core repositories and core-team maintained plugins:

Core Repos:
* pulp/pulp
* pulp/devel
* pulp/pulp-ci

Plugin Repos:
* pulp/pulp_file
* pulp/pulp_python
* pulp/pulp_rpm
* pulp/crane
* pulp/pulp_docker
* pulp/pulp_puppet
* pulp/pulp_ostree

This policy is intended as the default for all software in the Pulp ecosystem unless explicitly
stated otherwise.


## Criteria

Overall the candidate must have demonstrated commitment and care towards the needs of all Pulp
users and not only their own interests. Also they must have the experience to be trusted with major
aspects of Pulp functionality in that area.

These requirements are somewhat vague by design and leave the decision to the judgement of the
existing developers. Users rely on the judgement of developers already, so to rely on that judgement
to accept new contributors is reasonable. Anyone who specifically wants to get more involved should
approach the core devs about mentorship.


## Process

A nomination or self-nomination can be sent to the pulp-dev email list and must contain state the
following:

* Name and email of the nominee. This can be a self-nomination.
* Repositories being requested
* [Specific paths](https://blog.github.com/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/) or the entire repo
* Vote end date. Must be 7 calendar days from now.

To pass, a unanimous +1 vote is required from other committers in that area. Specifically:

* Adding a committer to a subsystem requires 100% vote participation from all existing maintainers
  of that subsystem.
* Creating a first owner of a subsystem requires 100% vote participation from that repository's
  committers.
* Adding a committer for a repository requires 100% vote participation from that repository's
  committers. 

If a nomination does not pass, the candidate may be re-nominated after a cool down period of 60
days.


## Drawbacks

A single developer can block a new candidate. This could limit contribution unnecessarily and
possibly create fairness issues.

Candidates might get waived through because casting a blocking vote can be uncomfortable.


## Alternatives

One alternative is to never add new committers. That is not a good option.

Another alternative is to use hard metrics such as time involved, feature planned and implemented,
bugs fixed, etc. Overall hard metric system can be gamed which is a major downside. Also a metrics
based process does not help unify the committer base like a unanimous vote would.


## Unresolved Questions

How will the commit bit be removed?
