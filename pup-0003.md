## Summary

This PUP is to redefine our git workflow to use cherry-picking instead of
merging commits forward from x.y-dev branches. Using this model, Pull Requests
(PRs) would be made against master and then bug fixes would be cherry-picked to
the older x.y-release branch as needed. Hotfixes would be cherry-picked from
x.y-release branch into master.

## Motivation

Currently in Pulp, we merge features to master. However, bug fixes are merged
to x.y-dev branches which then are merged to master (a process called "merging
forward"). More info about merging forward can be found in our documentation:

http://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.12/dev-guide/contributing/merging.html#merging-your-changes

Also, a good illustration of this process is outlined in the following webpage:

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

As a result, our git history is complex with multiple branches feeding into one
another and numerous merge commits. Using cherry-picks would simplify our git
history by keeping it more linear and eliminating merge commits.

Opening a PR requires knowledge of our current process. This can create a
barrier to entry for community members. With the cherry-pick model, all PRs are
opened against master and the onus to update older x.y-release branches is on
automated tooling and the person merging (who usually has better knowledge of
which branches a commit needs to be applied to), when conflicts arise.

We've also seen some mistakes where branches are accidentally merged into other
branches. These situations have occurred multiple times and each time required
multiple people working several hours to resolve the problem. After being
resolved, the git history is convoluted with huge negative commits which later
caused confusion at release time. Commits could be accidentally cherry-picked,
but this would be less disastrous since it's only a single commit.

Changes that we want to only be made to older x.y-dev branches (but not to
newer ones) still need to be merged forward. We could eliminate the need for
this with cherry-picking. It's worth noting though that this rarely happens.

In our current workflow, all bug fixes are made against x.y-dev branches and
merged forward. If they were instead cherry-picked from master to x.y-release
we have the choice of backporting with conflict resolution or leave the changes
exclusively on master.

Moreover, when the merge forward happens, sometimes the implementation needs to
be reworked and conflict resolution done. This reworking never goes through a
review process and is usually done by a single developer who tries to get it
right. This has caused issues in the past when a merge forward left the
implementation on master broken.

## Detailed Design

This proposal would modify the current branching scheme[1], keeping master and
the x.y-release branches, while dropping x.y-dev. The workflow by which changes
are moved between the branches also changes. The cherry picking process will
apply to Pulp2, Pulp3, and future Pulp versions.

The process works a bit differently depending on whether the change is a new
feature, bug fix, or hotfix.

#### New Feature

1. All feature PRs are opened and merged against master. No cherry picking will
   occur since new features only land on master.

#### Bug Fix

1. All bug fix PRs are opened against master
2. After the PR is ready to be merged, the person merging the commit would
   first merge the commit to master. Then, this person updates the platform
   release field on the issue.  Automated tooling will, at release time,
   attempt to cherry-pick from master to the latest x.y-release branch
   opening a PR with all the changes for a release.

#### Hotfix

The current hotfix process[2] would remain basically unchanged. However,
instead of merging forward the commit, we'd use cherry-picking.

1. The affected release would be branched to create the hotfix branch and a
   hotfix would be applied to the hotfix branch.
2. After the release, the hotfix gets cherry-picked via PR into the x.y-release
   branch.
3. The change is then cherry-picked into master by PR.
4. The person cherry-picking would also need to track in Redmine which release
   branches the change has been made to.

### Conflicts

If the cherry-pick has conflicts, we should assess why the conflicts arose (missed
commit, depends on feature work, etc...) and evaluate if it should be resolved for
the next z release.

### Using git cherry-pick

When performing the cherry-pick in git, use the `-x` flag which adds the
original commit id to the commit message of the cherry-pick. This will help
track changes across branches.

### Updating Redmine

When a cherry-pick is needed for a release, the release field of the issue in
Redmine should be set to x.y.z. For example, when a cherry-pick is ready for
2.13-release, the issue's release field should be set to 2.13.z (e.g. 2.13.4).
This is so release tooling will ensure commits land where they are supposed to.
For a hotfix that is applied to a release branch, the release branch is set to
the hotfix release version.

### Timeframe

When this proposal is accepted, we'll work with release engineering to determine
a date to switch to cherry-picking. After a date has been picked, an
announcement will be sent out to the pulp-dev list with the planned date. After
this date, we should begin to follow this proposal. Also, we'll enter in Redmine
issues to update our docs accordingly after this proposal has been accepted.

## Drawbacks

Git is really built for changes to be merged between branches. For example,
when cherry-picking a change, the commit is assigned a new id but when merging
the commit, it retains the same id. It makes looking up the commit to see what
branches it's been applied to easier. If we cherry-pick, we have to track this
information externally to git. This means also having to remember to update
Redmine.

Switching to this model also creates some inconsistency. Looking at git history,
you will see merge commits between branches (e.g. merges from the x.y-dev branch
to master) up until the date in which we switch to cherry-picking.

Defaulting to master, and requiring extra steps to get a change onto the
current x.y-dev branch, is likely to result in fewer bug fixes making it onto
x.y-dev branches. We can and should try to be diligent about cherry-picking fixes
to the x.y-dev branch, but the path of least resistance may prove too tempting
at times.

## Alternatives

### Keeping the current model

See the prior sections like "Motivation" and "Drawbacks" for a discussion on this.

### Merge forward less often

Perhaps keep the current model but merge less often. This would help to prevent
accidents and keep the git history cleaner. There are some drawbacks however to
this. One would be an increased chance of merge conflicts if we merge less
often. However, we could also use Github's PR functionality to allow for code
reviews of merges. This would also help to decrease accidental merges.
